### 4 Interface to `GEDLIB`

[`GEDLIB`](https://github.com/dbblumenthal/gedlib) is an easily extensible C++ library for (suboptimally) computing the graph edit distance between attributed graphs. [A Python interface](https://github.com/jajupmochi/graphkit-learn/tree/master/gklearn/gedlib) for `GEDLIB` is integrated in this library, based on [`gedlibpy`](https://github.com/Ryurin/gedlibpy) library.

### 5 Computation optimization methods

* Python’s `multiprocessing.Pool` module is applied to perform **parallelization** on the computations of all kernels as well as the model selection.
* **The Fast Computation of Shortest Path Kernel (FCSP) method** [8] is implemented in *the random walk kernel*, *the shortest path kernel*, as well as *the structural shortest path kernel* where FCSP is applied on both vertex and edge kernels.
* **The trie data structure** [9] is employed in *the path kernel up to length h* to store paths in graphs.

## Issues

* This library uses `multiprocessing.Pool.imap_unordered` function to do the parallelization, which may not be able to run correctly under Windows system. For now, Windows users may need to comment the parallel codes and uncomment the codes below them which run serially. We will consider adding a parameter to control serial or parallel computations as needed.

* Some modules (such as `Numpy`, `Scipy`, `sklearn`) apply [`OpenBLAS`](https://www.openblas.net/) to perform parallel computation by default, which causes conflicts with other parallelization modules such as `multiprossing.Pool`, highly increasing the computing time. By setting its thread to 1, `OpenBLAS` is forced to use a single thread/CPU, thus avoids the conflicts. For now, this procedure has to be done manually. Under Linux, type this command in terminal before running the code:
```
$ export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1
```
Or add `export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1` at the end of your `~/.bashrc` file, then run
```
$ source ~/.bashrc
```
to make this effective permanently.
